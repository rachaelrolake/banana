                        <li>

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Climate: Bananas thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with temperatures between
                             26째C to 30째C (78째F to 86째F) and high humidity.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Propagation: Bananas are usually propagated through suckers (shoots that grow from the base 
                            of the plant), as the seeds are not commonly used for commercial cultivation.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Growth Cycle: Banana plants take about 9-12 months from planting to harvest. The plant 
                            produces a large flower spike, which eventually develops into a bunch of bananas.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Harvesting: Bananas are harvested while still green and allowed to ripen during 
                            transportation or storage. This helps in reducing damage and prolonging shelf life.
                        </li>

                </li>
